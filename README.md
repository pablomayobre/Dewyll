## :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Game Rules

Manual is coming soon!

## :sparkles: Inspiration

### Where do the mechanics come from?

This game is of course inspired by Chess and Spanish Draughts, keeping all the movements and crowning mechanics, there is a big difference though, since it tries to add some luck into the mix, while keeping strategy as a big part of the game.

This is achieved through cards! Cards are used to choose your next movement, but what piece moves is not dependant on the card you chose.

This idea of all pieces having the same movement oportunity and strategic advantage is borrowed from Draughts.

### No one tried this before?

There is a similar game called [PAWNBARIAN](https://j4nw.itch.io/pawnbarian) but it has a different set of rules and principles. Dewyll is closer to Chess, since it remains multiplayer and with multiple pieces.

I haven't found any other examples, so if you find one, you can open an issue!

### What about art and music?

All the art and music is based around [Celtic coulture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts) which is where [Gwyddbwyll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidchell) (also called _Fidchell_) came from, this game is occassionaly claimed as a predecessor of Chess. In modern Welsh, [_Gwyddbwyll_](https://glosbe.com/cy/en/gwyddbwyll) is the name for Chess.

### Where does the name come from?

> _Dec_ (Deck) + _Gwyddbwyll_ (Chess) = _Dewyll_.

Dewyll has a really close pronunciation to [_twyll_](https://glosbe.com/cy/en/twyll) which in Welsh means _deception_, and yeah, you'd be deceived if you think this game is just Chess!

### Why Welsh anyway?

[Welsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welsh_language) is one of the 3 languages derived from [Celtic languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtic_languages) that is still used to this day.

Also there is another lucky coincidence and it's that, I'm from [Trelew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trelew), one of the first towns founded by Welsh immigrants in Patagonia.
